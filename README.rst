Sprezz README
=============

Sprezzatura is a certain nonchalance, so as to conceal all art and make
whatever one does or say appear to be without effort and almost without any
thought about it. It is the ability to display an easy facility in
accomplishing difficult actions which hides the conscious effort that went
into them.
